# ServeData 


## Version 1.3.8

A simple server based on [stubdb](https://github.com/cris691/stubdb) for serving all types of data.

Already includes schemas and users, and groups, and authentication, and authorization and permissions. 

Will soon include #18, #19, #20 and #21


## Using this template

You need to populate the secrets directory, with a G Suite/GMail API key with sender permissions, and (if you want fun error pages), a Giphy API key.

Also right now there's some places in the templates where I used my email (cris@dosycorp.com), so you probably want to replace that.

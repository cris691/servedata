# ServeData 


## Version 1.4.0

A simple server based on [stubdb](https://github.com/cris691/stubdb) for serving all types of data, while attempting to meet [ROCA](https://roca-style.org/) guidelines.

Already includes schemas and users, and groups, and authentication, and authorization and permissions. 


## Using this template

You need to populate the secrets directory, with a G Suite/GMail API key with sender permissions, and (if you want fun error pages), a Giphy API key.

Also right now there's some places in the templates where I used my email (cris@dosycorp.com), so you probably want to replace that.
